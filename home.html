<!-- Greetings, grader. I am Kenneth Tjendra, creator of this restaurant html page project. I followed the  requirements to the best of my ability, but I felt 
that there was much ambiguity. For example, I put the menu items in a table because since the beverage items were supposed to be in one, it implied the menu items
were supposed to be one as well. However, due to the unique nature of te circumstances, there was no one I could ask for clarification on such things.

I plan on turning my project in early. If  you find that something does not meet the criteria you are looking for, please get back to me through whatever avenues this
project takes to reach you. I feel confident with my knowledge of HTML , CSS, and Bootstrap after these lessons, so I have no doubt I can provide whatever is needed.

Until then, I will try to meet the criteria in the simplest way possible to avoid any complications. Thank you for your time and consideration! -->
